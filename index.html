<p> I’m currently on summer break, I’m a rising senior. I still have no idea what I want to do after high school which sounds bad but I have decide sometime. During this summer I decided to attend girls who code in hopes that I would learn something new. I could say by now three weeks in that I have definitely learned some basics about coding compared to when I started the program. </p>

<h2 align=center> Hobbies: </h2>

<p>I can’t really think about any other hobbies that I have other than photography. Some people ask me about how got into it and how started but to be honest I myself don’t know. I just say that I started out of nowhere when I started to travel and that when just started to take pictures randomly of what I thought was interesting so it just came naturally I guess. </p>
